# Lil'game

This is a simple game board and game piece created using web components. The goal was to test the libraries and explore how to use them to create an interactive UI.

The libraries used are:

- [@dvo/chips](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dvo/chips), used to automatically lazy load web-components written as individual HTML files.
- [#dvo/fc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dvo/fc), used to create web-components without the need for classes, and thus saving on a lot of boilerplate.
